This is to help quickly create jil files that describe jobs for different environments.

This utility is intended for people who only have read only access to autosys, like developers at say a financial institution.

Purpose:

Lets say you are developing an application, and you have 15 or 20 jobs that have to be developed, maintained and deployed to different environments. A typical setup might have a
Dev environment, Integration environment, a pre-production environment, and a production environment along with an instance used for disaster recovery (DR).

Thats alot of job descriptions to maintain and deploy.
